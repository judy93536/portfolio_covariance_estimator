# Methodology Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the theoretical foundations, empirical methodology, and implementation details of the Portfolio Covariance Estimator framework.

## 1. Theoretical Background

### 1.1 The Covariance Estimation Problem

Portfolio optimization requires accurate estimates of the covariance matrix **Σ** describing asset return relationships. The challenge arises from the **bias-variance trade-off** in statistical estimation:

- **Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM)**: Unbiased but high variance, especially when T ≈ N
- **Structured Estimators**: Introduce bias but reduce variance through regularization

#### Mathematical Framework

Given asset returns **R** ∈ ℝ^(T×N):

```
Σ̂_sample = (1/(T-1)) ∑(t=1 to T) (r_t - μ̂)(r_t - μ̂)ᵀ
```

Where:
- T = number of time periods
- N = number of assets  
- r_t = return vector at time t
- μ̂ = sample mean vector

### 1.2 Estimation Challenges

#### High-Dimensional Problems
When N/T ratio approaches 1:
- **Rank deficiency**: Singular covariance matrices
- **Eigenvalue instability**: Small eigenvalues amplify estimation noise
- **Optimization issues**: Spurious portfolio solutions

#### Non-Stationarity
Financial markets exhibit:
- **Regime changes**: Sudden shifts in correlation structure
- **Time-varying volatility**: GARCH effects and volatility clustering
- **Structural breaks**: Economic crises and policy changes

## 2. Covariance Estimation Methods

### 2.1 Shrinkage Estimators

Shrinkage estimators combine sample estimates with structured targets:

```
Σ̂_shrink = (1-δ)Σ̂_sample + δF
```

Where:
- δ ∈ [0,1] = shrinkage intensity
- F = shrinkage target matrix

#### 2.1.1 Ledoit-Wolf Estimator

**Target Matrix**: Constant correlation structure
```
F_ij = {
  s_ii,                    if i = j
  ρ̄√(s_ii × s_jj),       if i ≠ j
}
```

**Optimal Shrinkage Intensity**:
```
δ* = max(0, min(1, (π̂ - ρ̂)/(γ̂ × n)))
```

Where:
- π̂ = asymptotic variance of sample covariance entries
- ρ̂ = asymptotic covariance between sample and target
- γ̂ = squared Frobenius distance between sample and target
- n = effective sample size

**Implementation Notes**:
- Automatically adapts to data characteristics
- Preserves individual asset variances
- Shrinks correlations toward market average

#### 2.1.2 Identity Shrinkage

**Target Matrix**: Zero correlation assumption
```
F = diag(s_11, s_22, ..., s_NN)
```

**Use Cases**:
- Well-diversified sector portfolios
- High-quality institutional data
- When genuine correlations are low

#### 2.1.3 Diagonal Shrinkage

**Target Matrix**: Equal variance assumption
```
F = σ̄² × I_N
```

Where σ̄² = average sample variance

### 2.2 Random Matrix Theory (RMT) Approaches

RMT provides theoretical bounds for eigenvalue distributions under null hypothesis of no correlation.

#### 2.2.1 Marchenko-Pastur Distribution

For N×N sample covariance matrix with ratio q = N/T:

**Eigenvalue Bounds**:
```
λ_± = σ²(1 ± √q)²
```

Where σ² = average variance

**Signal Detection**:
- Eigenvalues > λ_+ indicate genuine correlations
- Eigenvalues < λ_+ are noise and should be cleaned

#### 2.2.2 RMT-Standard Cleaning

```
λ_cleaned = {
  λ_i,                           if λ_i > λ_+
  mean(λ_j : λ_j ≤ λ_+),        otherwise
}
```

#### 2.2.3 RMT-Conservative Cleaning

```
λ_cleaned = {
  λ_i,                                    if λ_i > λ_+
  geom_mean(λ_j : λ_j ≤ λ_+),           otherwise
}
```

**Geometric mean preserves more eigenvalue structure than arithmetic mean**

## 3. Empirical Methodology

### 3.1 Rolling Window Validation

#### Training Phase
- **Window size**: 200 trading days
- **Estimation**: Compute covariance matrix using each method
- **Portfolio optimization**: Solve for minimum variance portfolios

#### Testing Phase  
- **Duration**: 30 trading days
- **Measurement**: Out-of-sample portfolio performance
- **Metric**: Annualized portfolio standard deviation

#### Mathematical Framework

**Portfolio Optimization Problem**:
```
min (1/2)wᵀΣw
subject to:
  1ᵀw = 1              (weights sum to 1)
  μᵀw ≥ r_min          (minimum return constraint)
  w ≥ 0                (long-only constraint)
```

Where:
- w = portfolio weight vector
- Σ = estimated covariance matrix
- μ = expected return vector
- r_min = minimum daily return (default: 0.0004 = ~10% annual)

### 3.2 Performance Metrics

#### Primary Metric
**Annualized Portfolio Risk**:
```
σ_annual = σ_daily × √252
```

#### Comparative Metrics
- **Risk Improvement**: (σ_SCM - σ_method) / σ_SCM × 100%
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of periods where method outperforms SCM
- **Sharpe Proxy**: -σ_annual (lower risk = higher score)

### 3.3 Statistical Analysis

#### Shrinkage Intensity Tracking
Monitor adaptive behavior of shrinkage estimators:
- **Time series**: δ_t over rolling windows
- **Regime detection**: Sudden changes in optimal shrinkage
- **Market stress response**: Behavior during volatile periods

#### Eigenvalue Analysis
Track signal/noise separation:
- **Signal eigenvalues**: Count above Marchenko-Pastur bounds
- **Condition number**: max(λ)/min(λ) before and after cleaning
- **Spectral density**: Distribution of eigenvalues

## 4. Data Quality Assessment

### 4.1 Corporate Action Handling

**Critical preprocessing requirements**:
- Split adjustments for historical continuity
- Dividend adjustments for total return calculation
- Merger/delisting handling for survivorship bias

**Validation approach**:
```
# Test consistency across data sources
correlation(returns_source1, returns_source2) > 0.95
```

### 4.2 Eigenvalue Spectrum Analysis

**Quality indicators**:
- Smooth eigenvalue decay (no artificial jumps)
- Reasonable largest eigenvalue (market factor)
- Consistent spectral density across sources

### 4.3 Missing Data Treatment

**Exclusion criteria**:
- Assets with >1% missing observations
- Periods with >5% missing cross-sectional data
- Assets with insufficient liquidity (< 500 trading days)
